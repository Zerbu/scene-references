name="Scene References"
description="A simple Godot plugin that adds a \"SceneReference\" resource class and a quick way to assign one to a scene.
A SceneReference can be used to reference the scene from a variable elsewhere in the project, and is more efficient than using PackedScene or loading from the scene path directly."
